      SUBROUTINE GENFAM(Y2,IBLK,FREQ,Z,FA,DUA,DLA,DMS,DUS,DLS)
c**********************************************************************
c          Re-written 3.June.93 by Greg Hand because previous version was
c          really incorrect. It made an attempt to limit Sigma Fam (DMS)
c          to a 10 MHz frequency, but the indicies I and J became
c          confused, and the result was not correct. Ironically,
c          Sigma Fam was the only result that was computed correctly.
c          DUA, DLA, DUS, DLS were all incorrect.  This current
c          version should limit DMS to 10 MHz and the others to 20 MHz
c          because their curves end at 20 MHz. Unfortunately, this error
c          has probably existed since time began, and it may take a
c          while for this corrected version to propagate into all version
c          that exist. The magnitude of the errors in DUA, DLA, DUS, DLS
c          could approach +/- 4dB at 20MHz.  However, for use in
c          propagation prediction programs such as IONCAP, these errors
c          are almost unnoticable because Atmospheric Noise is not
c          the driving force at HF frequencies.

c          INPUTs:
c              Y2 = latitude of point of interest
c                   only cares if + or - to flip Northern/Southern Hemisphere
c              IBLK = time block of interest (local time 1=0000-0400)
c              FREQ = Frequency in MHz
c              Z = 1 MHz Fam value

c          OUTPUTs:
c              FA = Frequency variation of Fam
c              DUA = Du = ratio of upper decile to median value (Fam)
c              DLA = Dl = ratio of median value (Fam) to lower decile
c              DMS = Sigma Fam = standard deviation of values of Fam
c              DUS = Sigma Du  = standard deviation of values of Du
c              DLS = Sigma Dl  = standard deviation of values of Dl
